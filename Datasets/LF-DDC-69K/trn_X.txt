Welcome to our show Today I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandw
Let s start with the basics bread Bread is an important ingredient here You need to remember one thing choose the bread according to the following criteria freshness crumb and color If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown 
Now that our bread is ready let s talk about the ingredients Of course each person s palate is different but I m going to give you a few tips that you ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light The best choices here are evident — cucumbers tomatoes onions sweet pepper or chilli lettuce and of
Last but not least we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper or we can combine mustard sauce mayonnaise ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor It s always 
That s all the time we have for
